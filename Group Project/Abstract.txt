In recent years, the movie industry has proven to be a lucrative investment. But, only if handled properly. To determine how to make it as profitable as possible, we'll be looking a data set of 256 movies released in 2017. By looking at the release dates, distributors, genres, and MPAAs, we'll determine the positive and negative correlations between these variables and the total gross and tickets sold of each movie. Our study could give us insight into if certain genres are more successful than others, or if specific release dates make movies more successful or not. Distributors could use these findings to decide on what kind of movies to make and when to release them.
